# PowerBI_waste-free-plante-Dashboard
provides Dashboard on how much food is going uneaten in the United States.


## Data Set :
- Data comes from ReFED’s Food Waste Monitor, which provides data on how much food is going uneaten in the United States,
  why it’s happening, and where it goes.

## Reqirments :
- Create a report with multiple tabs.
   The data provided includes data on food production and surplus by state, year, and cause.
   It also includes data on proposed food waste solutions and their impact.
   To set the scene of the problem, I used PowerPoint to create the icons for the first page of my report and used a simple text box on the second page.
   The last 2 pages of the report display the food waste data.
   Note: if you have the new formatting pane turned on formatting a shape map is difficult. Turning it off will be helpful!
- Create your page navigator.
  On the insert tab of the ribbon, insert buttons and select navigator, page navigator.
- Format your page navigator. Customize the shape, colors, and font size.
  Choose font sizes of 12pt or larger for readability.
  Notice that if you add additional tabs, the page navigator adjusts accordingly!
  To test page navigation, hold the ctrl key while selecting the navigation button.
-Hide all tabs of your report except for the first tab.
 This will ensure that end-users see only the navigation options you provide.
